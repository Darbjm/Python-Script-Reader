government,44,"• The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi government ? a phased redeployment of U

•  Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable

•  The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families

• And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check

• Our government should work for us, not against us

•  And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program

•  I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill

•  So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials

•  That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives

•  Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption

• Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police

•  Instead of consolidating the gains made by the Karzai government, we are backsliding towards chaos

•  When possible, this should be done in consultation with the Iraqi government ? but it should not depend on Iraqi approval

• We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes

•  In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U

• The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem

•  But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need

• In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost

•  Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government

•  While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons

•  We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to

• Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology

• An accountable, transparent government can break this cycle

•  I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands

• The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe

•  commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ? in a public and unambiguous way ? for such continued support

•  Dreams of democracy and hopes for a perfect government are now just that ? dreams and hopes

•  is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ? that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure Iraq

•  They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back

•  And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go

• But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still

•  And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe

•  We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government

• The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed

• And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war

• "" Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient

•  The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play

•  Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place

• In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government

•  In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people","• doc1.txt

How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?

•  It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans

• Americans everywhere are desperate for leadership

• Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans

•  Let's make it possible for hardworking Americans to save for retirement

• Americans called for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays ago

• These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ? a strategy no longer driven by ideology and politics, but one that is based on a realistic assessment of the sobering facts on the ground and our interests in the region

•  Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism

• 2,867 Americans have now died in this war

• Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton

president,20,"• It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in Iraq

•  To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you

•  He said that our economy has made ""great progress"" under this President

•  We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush

•  The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U

•  So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President

• And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about

• As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power

•  Last week, without a trace of irony, the President even chose Vietnam as the backdrop for remarks counseling “patience” with his policies in Iraq

•  Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism

• And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East

• What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same

•  And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of American resolve

• But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union

•  We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past

•  And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States

• And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States

• Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right

corruption,20,"•  One that serves its people and is free from corruption

•  It is being threatened by corruption

•  Willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in Kenya

•  Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption

• But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve

• Corruption has a way of magnifying the very worst twists of fate

• Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism

•  And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort

•  And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time

• What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions

•  Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust

•  In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else

• Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see

• By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future

• The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya

•  By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives

• In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government

• Corruption is not a new problem

•  The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels

• It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health

• Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive","• doc3.txt

washington,16,"• But Washington has a long way to go

• It's called the Ownership Society in Washington

• And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream

•  But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change

•  You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington

•  Change comes to Washington

•  You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington

•  I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington

•  When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty

•  In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own

•  Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again

•  I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands

•  I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington

•  But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W

political,15,"• The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement

•  commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ? in a public and unambiguous way ? for such continued support

•  The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution

•  We must instead turn our focus to those concrete objectives that are possible to attain ? namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home

•  But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement

•  Our best hope for success is to use the tools we have ? military, financial, diplomatic ? to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control

•  Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell

•  It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war

• But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes

•  In just the past three weeks, he has ? and I’m quoting from a New York Times article here ? “rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq

•  It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife

•  The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels

•  What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems

education,13,"• Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy

•  Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed

•  When John McCain said we could just ""muddle through"" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights

•  By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism

• The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism

•  We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions

•  Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security

•  As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism

•  I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease

• The final lesson is that in an interconnected world, the defeat of international terrorism ? and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations

•  We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction

• These challenges are not all of government's making

• Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom

•  The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past

• I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see

• And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments

•  I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left",• doc4.txt
independence,4,"• There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring

• Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy

• As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa

• An accountable, transparent government can break this cycle","• doc2.txt

elections,4,"• But elections are not enough

• Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that came to power in the December elections of 2002

Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in? Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country? Will all her childhood hopes be fulfilled?

• But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve

• What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions

bureaucracy,4,"•  But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy

•  We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy

• Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs

• And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East

lobbyists,4,"• Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it

•  But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own

•  I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands

How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?

• This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work

•  That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees","• doc1.txt

•  Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here

•  The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy
